# Bigram Frequency Counter with Map-Reduce (Shuffle & Sort)

This project implements a **Map function from scratch** with shuffle and sort functionality to find the most frequent **bi-grams** (pairs of consecutive words) in a given text file.  
The implementation is inspired by the **MapReduce paradigm**, as taught in Lecture 8.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a large text file containing real-world textual data. Your task is to implement a **map function** that:
- Reads the file in **partitions** using a user-specified buffer size (RAM in MB).
- Extracts **key bi-grams** from the text:
  - A **bi-gram** is an ordered sequence of two words where the second word appears immediately after the first.
  - Both words must contain at least **three English letters**.
  - Bi-grams must **exclude articles, prepositions, and conjunctions**.
- Ensures all words are **lowercased** before counting.
- Performs **shuffle and sort** on the intermediate results.
- Produces the **top K most frequent bi-grams** from the input file.

The program must handle:
- **Corrupt bytes, unknown characters, and non-English content** gracefully.
- Tokenization of words using **non-English characters and digits as boundaries**.

## ⚙️ Example

**Input text:**
```
IIT Kharagpur is the oldest IIT.
```

**Key bi-grams:**
```
(iit kharagpur)
(oldest iit)
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Partitioning**: Reads input file in chunks based on user-defined buffer size (MB).  
- **Tokenizer**: Extracts only alphabetic words (`[a-zA-Z]+`).  
- **Filtering**: Removes articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and stopwords.  
- **Lowercasing**: Ensures case-insensitive processing.  
- **Bigram Detection**: Creates pairs of consecutive words that meet constraints.  
- **Shuffle & Sort**: Aggregates, shuffles, and sorts bigram counts.  
- **Top-K Extraction**: Outputs the most frequent K bi-grams.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) library

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install nltk
```

**First-time NLTK setup:**
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run from the Linux command line:

```bash
python code.py <input_file> <buffer_size_MB> <k>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<input_file>`: Path to the text file (e.g., data.txt)
- `<buffer_size_MB>`: Amount of RAM (in MB) used for partitioning the file
- `<k>`: Number of most frequent bi-grams to output

**Example:**
```bash
python code.py data.txt 1024 20
```

This will:
1. Partition `data.txt` into chunks of 1024 MB each.
2. Process each chunk to extract and count valid bi-grams.
3. Shuffle & sort across partitions.
4. Print the top 20 most frequent bi-grams.

## 📊 Output

**Example final output (`shuffled_sorted_bigrams.txt`):**
```
('iit', 'kharagpur'): 15
('machine', 'learning'): 12
('deep', 'learning'): 9
...
```

**Console output for top_k_occurrences:**
```
('iit', 'kharagpur'): 15
('machine', 'learning'): 12
...
```

## 🛠️ Notes

The implementation is robust against:
- Non-English characters
- Corrupt or malformed bytes

Bi-grams are only considered if both words:
- Are alphabetic with length ≥ 3
- Are not in the excluded stopword list
